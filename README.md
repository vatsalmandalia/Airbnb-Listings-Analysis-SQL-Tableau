This repository contains the project on Airbnb Listings Analysis done using SQL and Tableau. This project is inspired from the project - Analysis of Airbnb Data Using SQL - done by Avery Smith.

## Structure of Analysis

2. Preparation and Cleaning
3. Business problems
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Summary of the findings

## Background

Airbnb is an online market-place for property owners to host their properties for tourists looking to book for short-term homestays. It is a medium between hosts and potential customers looking to make book listings in specific locations. Airbnb currently has over 100,000+ listings spread over 6 countries.

For my analysis, I am only considering only the data for Austin, Texas.

## Preparation and Cleaning

There are three datasets sourced from Inside Airbnb - listings, calendar, reviews.

In the listings data, the 'price' field is of TEXT data type and contains a non-numeric character '$'. This is treated from the 'Modify table' option in 'Edit' menu.

Data has been scraped on 2022-06-08 from the source. Tools employed are DB Browser for SQLite and Tableau Public.

## Business problems

- How many listings and hosts are there in Austin? Are there hosts with multiple listings?
- Across neighborhoods, what is the proportion of listings and the price situation?
- What is the price per bed trend by each neighborhood?
- What is the division of each type of room among all listings? How does the price correlate with a room type and neighbourhood?
- In the next 30-day period, who are the top revenue earners? How does this revenue potential vary by neighborhoods and room types?
- What is the outlook of superhosts across each neighborhood â€“ in terms of numbers, price and ratings?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Below is the queries implemented in DB Browser for SQLite for addressing the above business questions.

## Summary of findings:<BR>

- **Hosts and listings**: In Austin, we have 17071 listings and 9556 hosts. 80% of hosts have a single listing and there are hosts holding listings in the range from 1 to 400.
- **Neighbourhood**: Austin accounts for approximately 42% listings against rest 97 neighborhoods. 4 of top 5 priced neighborhoods hold only 1 listing.
Price per bed: Rollingwood has the highest price per bed rate around $1000, 80% more than at Westlake hills. Cypress Mill having 15 beds offers rate similar to Westlake Hills.
- **Room type**: Entire homes or apartments make up 83% of the properties, with their average price  highest. Hotel rooms cost more than combined price of shared and private rooms. Private rooms make up 16% of the listing market.
- **Revenue potential**: For the next 30 days, Austin projects close to 47% revenue share. Entire homes or apartments have more than 50-60% revenue share in majority of neighborhoods.
- **Superhosts**: 32% of property owners are superhosts, with majority of them in Austin and 54 such neighborhoods having more superhosts than regular hosts.
- **Ratings**: Superhosts appear to receive higher review scores on average for cleanliness, location, communication etc. than regular hosts.

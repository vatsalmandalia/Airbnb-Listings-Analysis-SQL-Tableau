## Background

Airbnb is an online market-place for property owners to host their properties for tourists looking to book for short-term homestays. It is a medium between hosts and potential customers looking to make book listings in specific locations. Airbnb currently has over 100,000+ listings spread over 6 countries.

The aim behind this analysis is to understand the local rental market in Austin, Texas and how Airbnb has become the key choice for vacationers interested in temporary accommodation at their holiday destination.

## Preparation and Cleaning

There are three datasets sourced from Inside Airbnb - listings, calendar, reviews.

In the listings data, the 'price' field is of TEXT data type and contains a non-numeric character '$'. This is treated manually from the 'Modify table' option in 'Edit' menu in DB Browser for SQLite application.

Data has been scraped as on 8th June 2022 from the Inside Airbnb.

For executing queries to manipulate and mine data, I employ DB Browser for SQLite tool. Tableau Public has been utilised to visualize underlying trends and produce impactful dashboards.

## Business problems

- How many listings and hosts are there in Austin? Are there hosts with multiple listings?
- Across neighborhoods, what is the proportion of listings and the price situation?
- What is the price per bed trend by each neighborhood?
- What is the division of each type of room among all listings? How does the price correlate with a room type and neighbourhood?
- In the next 30-day period, who are the top revenue earners? How does this revenue potential vary by neighborhoods and room types?
- What is the outlook of superhosts across each neighborhood â€“ in terms of numbers, price and ratings?

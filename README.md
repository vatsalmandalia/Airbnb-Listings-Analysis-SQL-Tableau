# Airbnb-Listings-Analysis-SQL-Tableau

This repository contains the project on Airbnb Listings Analysis done using SQL and Tableau. This project is inspired from the Guided Project done by Avery Smith on Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Structure of Analysis:

1. Background
2. Preparation and Cleaning
3. Business problems
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Summary of the findings

## Background:

Airbnb is an online market-place for property owners to host their properties for tourists looking to book for short-term homestays. It is a medium between hosts and potential customers looking to make book listings in specific locations. Airbnb currently has over 100,000+ listings spread over 6 countries.

For my analysis, I am only considering only the data for Austin, Texas.

## Preparation and Cleaning:

There are three datasets sourced from Inside Airbnb - listings, calendar, reviews. In the listings data, the 'price' field is of TEXT data type and contains a non-numeric character '$'. This is treated using the below query.

UPDATE listings_austin
SET price = REPLACE(price, '$', '');

Data has been scraped on 2022-06-08 from the source. Tools employed are DB Browser for SQLite and Tableau Public.

## Business problems

- How many listings and hosts are there in Austin? Are there hosts with multiple listings?
- Across neighborhoods, what is the proportion of listings and the price situation?
- What is the price per bed trend by each neighborhood?
- What is the division of each type of room among all listings? How does the price correlate with a room type and neighbourhood?
- In the next 30-day period, who are the top revenue earners? How does this revenue potential vary by neighborhoods and room types?
- What is the outlook of superhosts across each neighborhood â€“ in terms of numbers, price and ratings?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Below is the queries implemented in DB Browser for SQLite for addressing the above business questions.
